Ingredients:

1 cup rolled oats
2 cups water or milk (dairy or non-dairy)
1 apple, cored and chopped
1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup (optional)
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Pinch of salt
Optional toppings: sliced almonds, chopped walnuts, raisins, or a drizzle of nut butter
Instructions:

In a saucepan, combine the oats, water or milk, chopped apple, honey or maple syrup (if desired), ground cinnamon, and salt.

Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.

Once it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 5-7 minutes, or until the oats are tender and the mixture has thickened to your liking. Stir occasionally.

Remove the saucepan from heat and let the oatmeal rest for a minute.

Give the oatmeal a final stir and transfer it to serving bowls.

Top the oatmeal with your preferred toppings, such as sliced almonds, chopped walnuts, raisins, or a drizzle of nut butter.

Serve the apple cinnamon oatmeal warm and enjoy!

Ingredients:

1 ripe banana
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon sugar (optional)
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup milk (dairy or non-dairy)
1 large egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Butter or oil for greasing the pan
Optional toppings: sliced bananas, berries, maple syrup, honey, or chopped nuts
Instructions:

In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe banana with a fork until smooth.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar (if using), baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

Add the mashed banana, milk, egg, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps are fine.

Preheat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Grease the surface with a small amount of butter or oil.

Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, about 2-3 minutes.

Flip the pancakes using a spatula and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until golden brown.

Transfer the cooked pancakes to a plate and keep them warm. Repeat the process with the remaining batter, greasing the skillet as needed.

Serve the banana pancakes warm with your choice of toppings, such as sliced bananas, berries, maple syrup, honey, or chopped nuts.

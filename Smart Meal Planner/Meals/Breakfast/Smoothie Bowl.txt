Ingredients:

1 frozen banana
1 cup frozen mixed berries (such as strawberries, blueberries, raspberries)
1/2 cup milk (dairy or non-dairy)
1 tablespoon nut butter (such as almond butter or peanut butter)
Optional toppings: sliced fruits, granola, nuts, seeds, shredded coconut, or honey
Instructions:

In a blender, combine the frozen banana, frozen mixed berries, milk, and nut butter.

Blend the ingredients until smooth and creamy. If the mixture is too thick, you can add a splash of milk and blend again until you reach a thick but pourable consistency.

Pour the smoothie into a bowl.

Top the smoothie bowl with your favorite toppings, such as sliced fruits, granola, nuts, seeds, shredded coconut, or a drizzle of honey.

Enjoy your smoothie bowl immediately with a spoon.

You can customize your smoothie bowl by adding other ingredients like spinach or kale for added nutrition, or by incorporating superfood powders like maca powder or spirulina. Feel free to get creative and make your own variations based on your taste preferences.

Ingredients:

2 large tortilla wraps
4 large eggs
1/4 cup chopped bell peppers (any color)
1/4 cup chopped onions
1/4 cup chopped tomatoes
1/4 cup chopped spinach or other leafy greens
Salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup shredded cheese (such as cheddar or Monterey Jack)
Optional toppings: sliced avocado, salsa, or hot sauce
Instructions:

In a bowl, whisk the eggs until well beaten. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and lightly coat it with cooking spray or a small amount of oil.

Add the chopped bell peppers and onions to the skillet and saut√© for 2-3 minutes until slightly softened.

Add the chopped tomatoes and spinach to the skillet and cook for another 1-2 minutes until the spinach wilts.

Pour the beaten eggs into the skillet with the vegetables. Scramble the eggs, stirring occasionally, until they are fully cooked but still moist.

Warm the tortilla wraps in a separate skillet or microwave according to the package instructions to make them more pliable.

Divide the scrambled egg mixture in half and place each portion in the center of a tortilla wrap.

Sprinkle shredded cheese on top of the eggs in each wrap.

Optional: Add sliced avocado, salsa, or hot sauce to the wraps for extra flavor.

Fold the sides of the tortilla wraps inward and roll them up tightly, creating a wrap shape.

Serve the veggie breakfast wraps immediately.

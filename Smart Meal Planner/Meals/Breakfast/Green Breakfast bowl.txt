Ingredients
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 cups kale chopped
2 cups shredded Brussels sprouts
2 cups cauliflower rice frozen or fresh
1 avocado
Thinly sliced green onions or fresh chives
Fresh lemon or lime juice
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper plus other favorite seasonings
2 eggs
Ghee or olive oil to cook the eggs
Instructions
Have your greens prepped and ready to go.  Heat a large skillet with 2 tablespoons of ghee or olive oil.  Once heated, add the shredded Brussels sprouts and cook about 30 seconds, then add the kale and sprinkle with a tablespoon of water. Stir to cook down, then season with sea salt, black pepper, and any other seasonings you like. Remove from the skillet to two bowls and cover to keep warm.

Add the cauliflower rice to the same skillet (you can add a bit more oil or ghee if needed) and season with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lime juice. Depending on whether your rice is frozen or fresh, you might need to cook anywhere between 1-5 minutes to soften it to preference.
Once done, arrange around the greens in both bowls.
For the eggs, I like to cook them sunny side up for this recipe so the yolks run into the veggies like a sauce or dressing. You can cook the eggs anyway you like. For my method, heat a nonstick skillet to medium low heat and add about a tablespoon of ghee or oil. Carefully crack each egg either directly into the skillet or first into a ramekin, then cover with a clear lid (so you can see the cooking progress) and cook until the white are done and yolks runny - about 1.5 - 2 minutes.
Peel and thinly slice your avocado and arrange over the greens and rice, top with the cooked eggs, and sprinkle all over with green onions. Enjoy right away!

Ingredients:

1/4 cup chia seeds
1 cup milk (dairy or non-dairy such as almond, coconut, or soy milk)
1 tablespoon sweetener (such as honey, maple syrup, or agave nectar)
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
Optional toppings: fresh berries, sliced fruits, nuts, coconut flakes, or granola

Instructions:

In a bowl or jar, combine the chia seeds, milk, sweetener, and vanilla extract. Stir well to combine and ensure there are no clumps of chia seeds.

Cover the bowl or jar and refrigerate it overnight, or for at least 4 hours, to allow the chia seeds to absorb the liquid and thicken into a pudding-like consistency.

After the chia pudding has set, give it a good stir to break up any clumps. If it appears too thick, you can add a splash of milk and stir until you reach your desired consistency.

Serve the chia pudding in bowls or glasses and add your favorite toppings, such as fresh berries, sliced fruits, nuts, coconut flakes, or granola.

Enjoy the chia pudding immediately or refrigerate it for up to 2-3 days.

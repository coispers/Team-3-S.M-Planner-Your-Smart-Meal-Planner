Ingredients:

4 large eggs
1 tablespoon butter or oil
1/4 cup diced onions
1/4 cup diced bell peppers (any color)
1/4 cup diced tomatoes
1/4 cup cooked and crumbled breakfast sausage or bacon (optional)
Salt and pepper to taste
4 large flour tortillas
Shredded cheese (such as cheddar or Monterey Jack)
Salsa, sour cream, or guacamole (optional, for serving)
Instructions:

In a bowl, whisk the eggs until well beaten. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Heat the butter or oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onions and bell peppers, and sauté until they are softened and slightly browned, about 3-4 minutes.

Add the diced tomatoes and cooked breakfast sausage or bacon (if using) to the skillet. Cook for another 2 minutes to heat them through.

Pour the beaten eggs into the skillet with the vegetables and meat. Scramble the eggs, stirring occasionally, until they are fully cooked but still moist.

Warm the flour tortillas in a separate skillet or microwave according to the package instructions to make them more pliable.

Place a spoonful of the scrambled egg mixture onto each tortilla. Sprinkle some shredded cheese on top.

Fold the sides of the tortilla inward and roll it up tightly, creating a burrito shape.

Optional: To melt the cheese and warm the burrito, you can place the assembled burritos in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for a few minutes or in a skillet over medium heat for 1-2 minutes on each side.

Serve the breakfast burritos hot with salsa, sour cream, or guacamole on the side, if desired.

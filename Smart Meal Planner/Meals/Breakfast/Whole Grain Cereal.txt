Ingredients:

2 cups whole grain flakes (such as oats, spelt flakes, or quinoa flakes)
1/2 cup nuts and seeds (such as almonds, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, or sunflower seeds)
1/4 cup dried fruits (such as raisins, cranberries, or chopped dates)
1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup (optional)
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon (optional)
Milk or non-dairy milk, to serve

Instructions:

Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C).

In a mixing bowl, combine the whole grain flakes, nuts, and seeds. You can roughly chop the nuts if desired.

If using honey or maple syrup, drizzle it over the mixture. Add cinnamon if desired for added flavor.

Stir the ingredients well until everything is evenly coated.

Spread the mixture onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat, ensuring it's in a single layer.

Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for about 15-20 minutes or until the cereal turns golden brown. Stir the mixture every 5 minutes to prevent burning.

Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the cereal cool completely.

Once cooled, mix in the dried fruits.

Store the homemade whole grain cereal in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.

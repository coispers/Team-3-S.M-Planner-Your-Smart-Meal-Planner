Ingredients:

1 pre-made pie crust (store-bought or homemade)
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, diced
1 bell pepper, diced
1 cup diced ham or cooked bacon (optional)
1 cup shredded cheese (such as cheddar, Swiss, or Gruyere)
4 large eggs
1 cup milk (dairy or non-dairy)
Salt and pepper to taste
Optional add-ins: chopped spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, or herbs like parsley or chives
Instructions:

Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out the pie crust and press it into a 9-inch pie dish or tart pan. Trim any excess crust from the edges.

Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onion and bell pepper and cook until softened and slightly browned, about 5-7 minutes.

If using, add the diced ham or cooked bacon to the skillet and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper until well combined.

Spread the cooked onion, bell pepper, and meat (if using) evenly over the bottom of the pie crust. Sprinkle the shredded cheese on top.

Pour the egg mixture over the filling in the pie crust, making sure it covers everything.

If desired, sprinkle any additional add-ins like chopped spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, or herbs on top.

Place the quiche in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the center is set and the top is golden brown.

Remove the quiche from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.

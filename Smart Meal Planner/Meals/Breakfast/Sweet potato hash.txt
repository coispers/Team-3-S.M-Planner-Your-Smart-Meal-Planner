Ingredients:

2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and diced
1 bell pepper, diced
1 small onion, diced
2 cloves of garlic, minced
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
Salt and pepper to taste
Optional add-ins: cooked crumbled bacon, chopped spinach, or diced tomatoes
Optional toppings: chopped fresh parsley or cilantro, avocado slices, or a fried egg
Instructions:

Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.

Add the diced sweet potatoes to the skillet and saut√© for about 5 minutes, until they start to soften slightly.

Add the diced bell pepper and onion to the skillet. Continue cooking for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender.

Add the minced garlic, paprika, ground cumin, dried thyme, salt, and pepper to the skillet. Stir well to coat the vegetables with the spices.

Cook the sweet potato hash for an additional 5-7 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are cooked through and slightly crispy on the outside. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.

Optional: If using, add any additional ingredients such as cooked crumbled bacon, chopped spinach, or diced tomatoes. Stir them into the hash and cook for a few more minutes to heat through.

Remove the skillet from heat and taste for seasoning. Adjust with more salt and pepper if needed.

Serve the sweet potato hash hot, topped with chopped fresh parsley or cilantro, avocado slices, or a fried egg if desired.

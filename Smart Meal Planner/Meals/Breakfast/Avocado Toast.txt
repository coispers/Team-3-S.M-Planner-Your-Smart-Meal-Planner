Ingredients:

1 ripe avocado
2 slices of bread (sourdough, whole wheat, or your preference)
Lemon juice (optional)
Salt and pepper to taste
Optional toppings: sliced tomatoes, red pepper flakes, microgreens, feta cheese, poached eggs, etc.
Instructions:

Start by slicing the avocado in half and removing the pit. Scoop out the flesh into a bowl.

Mash the avocado with a fork until you achieve your desired consistency. You can leave it slightly chunky or make it smooth.

Add a squeeze of lemon juice to the mashed avocado. This helps prevent browning and adds a tangy flavor. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Toast the slices of bread until they are crispy and golden brown.

Spread a generous amount of the mashed avocado onto each slice of toast, using the back of a spoon to evenly distribute it.

If desired, add additional toppings such as sliced tomatoes, red pepper flakes, microgreens, crumbled feta cheese, or a poached egg on top of the avocado.

Serve the avocado toast immediately while it's still warm. You can cut the slices in half diagonally for easier eating.

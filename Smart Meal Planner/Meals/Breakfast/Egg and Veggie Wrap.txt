
Here's a simple recipe for an egg and veggie wrap:

Ingredients:

2 large eggs
1/4 cup chopped bell peppers (any color)
1/4 cup chopped onions
1/4 cup chopped tomatoes
1/4 cup chopped spinach or other leafy greens
Salt and pepper to taste
2 large tortilla wraps
Optional toppings: shredded cheese, salsa, avocado slices, or hot sauce
Instructions:

In a bowl, whisk the eggs until well beaten. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and lightly coat it with cooking spray or a small amount of oil.

Add the chopped bell peppers and onions to the skillet and saut√© for 2-3 minutes until slightly softened.

Add the chopped tomatoes and spinach to the skillet and cook for another 1-2 minutes until the spinach wilts.

Pour the whisked eggs over the vegetables in the skillet. Allow the mixture to cook for a minute or two until the edges start to set.

Gently lift the edges of the egg mixture with a spatula and tilt the skillet to allow the uncooked egg to flow underneath. Continue doing this until most of the egg is cooked and set.

Once the eggs are fully cooked, divide the mixture into two portions and place each portion in the center of a tortilla wrap.

If desired, sprinkle some shredded cheese on top of the eggs.

Roll up the tortilla wraps tightly, tucking in the sides as you go.

Optional: You can heat the wraps in a panini press or lightly toast them in a skillet to give them a crispy exterior.

Serve the egg and veggie wraps immediately. You can top them with salsa, avocado slices, or hot sauce for extra flavor.

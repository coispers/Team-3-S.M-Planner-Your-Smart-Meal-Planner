Ingredients:

1 block of firm or extra-firm tofu
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 small onion, diced
1 bell pepper, diced
2 cloves of garlic, minced
1 teaspoon turmeric
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon black salt (Kala Namak) for an eggy flavor (optional)
Salt and pepper to taste
Fresh herbs (such as parsley or chives), for garnish (optional)
Sliced avocado or salsa, for serving (optional)
Instructions:

Drain the tofu and pat it dry with paper towels. Crumble the tofu into small, bite-sized pieces with your hands or a fork.

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.

Add the diced onion and bell pepper to the skillet and sauté until they become soft and slightly browned, about 5-7 minutes.

Add the minced garlic and sauté for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

Push the sautéed vegetables to one side of the skillet and add the crumbled tofu to the other side.

Sprinkle the turmeric, cumin, paprika, and black salt (if using) over the tofu. Gently stir everything together to evenly distribute the spices.

Cook the tofu scramble for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the tofu is heated through and slightly golden.

Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Optional: Garnish the tofu scramble with fresh herbs, such as parsley or chives.

Serve the tofu scramble hot with sliced avocado or salsa on the side if desired.

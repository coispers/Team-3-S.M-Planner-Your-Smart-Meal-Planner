Ingredients:

3 eggs
1/4 cup milk or non-dairy milk alternative (optional)
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup chopped bell peppers (any color)
1/4 cup chopped tomatoes
1/4 cup chopped mushrooms
1/4 cup chopped spinach
1/4 cup shredded cheese (such as cheddar or mozzarella)
Salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil or cooking spray
Instructions:

In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk (if using). Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.

Heat the olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the onions, bell peppers, and mushrooms. Saut√© for 3-4 minutes until the vegetables are slightly softened.

Add the tomatoes and spinach to the skillet and cook for another 1-2 minutes until the spinach wilts.

Pour the whisked eggs over the vegetables in the skillet, ensuring they are evenly distributed. Let the mixture cook for a minute or two until the edges start to set.

Gently lift the edges of the omelette with a spatula and tilt the skillet to allow the uncooked egg mixture to flow underneath. Continue doing this around the omelette until most of the liquid egg is cooked.

Sprinkle the shredded cheese over one half of the omelette. Fold the other half over the cheese, creating a half-moon shape. Cook for an additional minute to allow the cheese to melt.

Carefully slide the omelette onto a plate and serve hot. You can garnish it with additional chopped herbs or salsa if desired.

Enjoy your delicious veggie omelette!

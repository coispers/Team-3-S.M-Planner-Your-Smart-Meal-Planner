Ingredients:

1 cup cooked quinoa
1/2 cup milk (dairy or non-dairy)
1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Assorted toppings: fresh fruits (such as berries, sliced banana, or chopped apple), nuts, seeds, shredded coconut, or a drizzle of nut butter
Instructions:

In a saucepan, combine the cooked quinoa, milk, honey or maple syrup, vanilla extract, and ground cinnamon.

Heat the mixture over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until it reaches your desired consistency. If it becomes too thick, you can add a splash of milk to thin it out.

Once the quinoa mixture is warm and well combined, remove it from the heat.

Transfer the quinoa breakfast bowl into a serving bowl.

Top the quinoa with your choice of fresh fruits, nuts, seeds, shredded coconut, or a drizzle of nut butter.

Enjoy your quinoa breakfast bowl warm.

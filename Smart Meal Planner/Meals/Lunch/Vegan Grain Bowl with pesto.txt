Ingredients:
1 Cup dry quick cook farro
2 Cups pre-cooked lentils
1 Cup pesto (homemade or store bought)
8 Cups mixed greens
2 medium bell peppers, choice colors
INSTRUCTIONS
 
Cook farro according to package instructions (as well as lentils if prepping from dry).

While lentils and farro are cooking, add all pesto ingredients to a food processor, starting with just 2 tbsp of water. Pulse for roughly 30 seconds before scraping the sides and blending an additional 10-15 seconds. If pesto is too thick, add the additional 2 tbsp of water.

Remove the stalk and seeds from the bell peppers, and chop into ¼ - ½ inch pieces. Divide mixed greens into 4 separate bowls and top each with ¼ of the chopped peppers and ¼ of the farro.

Stir the lentils with half of the pesto before dividing between the bowls.

Drizzle the remainder of the pesto over each bowl and serve.

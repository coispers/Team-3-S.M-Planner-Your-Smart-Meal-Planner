1 tablespoon chili powder
2-3 cloves finely chopped garlic (about 1 tablespoon)
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon ground cumin
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoon olive oil

2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro leaves
1 small jalapeño or Serrano pepper seeded and finely minced
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice

Instructions
Combine marinade ingredients in a large bowl: brown sugar (2 tablespoons), chili powder (1 tablespoon), garlic (1 tablespoon), salt (1 teaspoon), cumin (1 teaspoon), pepper (½ teaspoon), olive oil (2 tablespoons), and lime juice (2 tablespoons). Mix well. Add chicken and stir to thoroughly coat. Cover and refrigerate for an hour or two. Thread chicken pieces onto 8 (12-inch) metal skewers.

Preheat the grill to medium-high. Cook the chicken kebabs for about 6 minutes per side or until the chicken is cooked through. Serve with the salsa!

Ingredients: 

1/4 cup sesame oil
1/2 cup liquid aminos
2 cloves garlic, peeled and pressed
1 tablespoon ground ginger
2 tablespoons granulated swerve
2 medium eggplants
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds

Instruction:
Combine sesame oil, liquid aminos, garlic, ginger, and swerve into a saucepan and whisk together over medium heat.

Bring the sauce to a light simmer, stirring frequently until it begins to thicken slightly. Remove from heat.

Remove the stems from the eggplants and slice into 1/8 in slices. You will get approximately five full slices from each eggplant for a total of ten slices.

Brush each slice of eggplant with the teriyaki sauce and place on a hot grill.

Sear each side, brushing with more sauce as it caramelizes.

Garnish with toasted sesame seeds and serve with remaining sauce.

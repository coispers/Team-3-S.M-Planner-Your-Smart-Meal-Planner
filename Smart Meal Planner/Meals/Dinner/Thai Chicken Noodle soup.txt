Ingredients:

2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, thinly sliced
4 cups chicken broth
1 can (13.5 ounces) coconut milk
2 stalks lemongrass, bruised and chopped into 2-inch pieces
3-4 slices galangal or ginger
3-4 kaffir lime leaves
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 tablespoon brown sugar (optional)
8 ounces rice noodles, cooked according to package instructions
1 cup sliced mushrooms
1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
1 small onion, thinly sliced
Fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish
Thai basil leaves, for garnish
Sliced red chili, for garnish (optional)
Lime wedges, for serving

Instructions:

In a large pot, bring the chicken broth to a boil. Add the lemongrass, galangal or ginger, and kaffir lime leaves. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 10 minutes to infuse the flavors.

Add the sliced chicken to the pot and cook until it's no longer pink and cooked through.

Stir in the coconut milk, fish sauce, soy sauce, lime juice, and brown sugar (if using). Simmer for an additional 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.

Add the sliced mushrooms, red bell pepper, and onion to the pot. Cook for about 3-4 minutes until the vegetables are tender-crisp.

Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning according to your preference, adding more fish sauce, lime juice, or brown sugar if desired.

Divide the cooked rice noodles among serving bowls.

Ladle the hot soup over the noodles, making sure to include some chicken and vegetables in each bowl.

Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves, Thai basil leaves, and sliced red chili (if desired).

Serve the Thai chicken noodle soup hot, with lime wedges on the side for squeezing over the soup.

Ingredients:

1 whole chicken (about 4-5 pounds)
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon paprika
Salt and pepper to taste
4-5 cups mixed vegetables (such as carrots, potatoes, onions, and Brussels sprouts), cut into bite-sized pieces
Fresh herbs (such as parsley or thyme) for garnish

Instructions:

Preheat your oven to 425째F (220째C) and place a rack in the middle of the oven.

Pat the chicken dry with paper towels. Rub the olive oil all over the chicken, making sure to coat it evenly.

In a small bowl, mix together the dried thyme, dried rosemary, dried oregano, paprika, salt, and pepper. Sprinkle this herb mixture over the chicken, rubbing it gently to adhere.

Place the chicken in a roasting pan or a baking dish, breast-side up.

In a separate bowl, toss the mixed vegetables with a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper.

Arrange the vegetables around the chicken in the roasting pan.

Place the roasting pan in the preheated oven and roast for about 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes, or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165째F (74째C) and the juices run clear when pierced.

If the chicken or vegetables are browning too quickly, you can cover them loosely with foil.

Once cooked, remove the roasting pan from the oven and let the chicken rest for about 10 minutes before carving.

Garnish with fresh herbs and serve the roasted chicken with the vegetables.

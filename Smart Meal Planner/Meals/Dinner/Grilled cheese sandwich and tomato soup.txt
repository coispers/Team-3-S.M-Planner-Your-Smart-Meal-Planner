Grilled Cheese Sandwich Ingredients:

4 slices of bread (white, wheat, or sourdough)
4-6 slices of cheese (cheddar, American, or your favorite melting cheese)
Butter, softened

Tomato Soup Ingredients:

2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 can (28 ounces/800g) crushed tomatoes
1 cup vegetable broth
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
Salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup heavy cream (optional, for added creaminess)

Grilled Cheese Sandwich Instructions:

Preheat a skillet or griddle over medium heat.

Take two slices of bread and butter one side of each slice.

Place one slice of bread, butter-side down, on the heated skillet. Add 2-3 slices of cheese on top of the bread and cover with the other slice of bread, butter-side up.

Cook the sandwich for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until the bread turns golden brown and the cheese melts. Press the sandwich gently with a spatula while cooking to help the cheese melt evenly.

Repeat the process with the remaining bread slices and cheese to make additional sandwiches.

Once cooked, remove the sandwiches from the skillet and let them cool slightly. Cut them in half if desired.

Tomato Soup Instructions:

In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic. Saut√© for about 5 minutes until the onion becomes translucent and the garlic is fragrant.

Add the crushed tomatoes, vegetable broth, sugar, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper to the pot. Stir well to combine.

Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.

Use an immersion blender or a regular blender to puree the soup until smooth. If using a regular blender, blend the soup in batches and be careful as the hot liquid can expand. Return the soup to the pot.

If desired, stir in the heavy cream to add creaminess to the soup. Heat the soup for an additional 2-3 minutes.

Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning if needed.

Ladle the tomato soup into bowls and serve alongside the grilled cheese sandwiches.

Enjoy your comforting grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup!

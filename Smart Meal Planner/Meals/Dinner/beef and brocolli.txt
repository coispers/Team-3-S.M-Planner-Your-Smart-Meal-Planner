Ingredients:

1 pound flank steak, thinly sliced against the grain
1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons oyster sauce
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ginger, grated
2 cups broccoli florets
1/2 cup beef broth
2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
1 teaspoon sesame oil (optional)
Salt and pepper to taste
Cooked rice, for serving

Instructions:

In a bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, oyster sauce, and cornstarch. Add the thinly sliced beef to the bowl and toss to coat it in the sauce mixture. Let it marinate for about 15-20 minutes.

Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger, and saut√© for about 1 minute until fragrant.

Add the marinated beef to the skillet and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until it is browned. Remove the beef from the skillet and set it aside.

In the same skillet, add the broccoli florets and beef broth. Cover the skillet and let the broccoli steam for about 3-4 minutes until it is bright green and crisp-tender.

In a small bowl, mix together the hoisin sauce and sesame oil (if using). Pour this sauce mixture into the skillet with the broccoli.

Return the cooked beef to the skillet with the broccoli. Stir everything together to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Continue to cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until the flavors meld together and the beef is cooked to your liking.

Remove from heat and serve the beef and broccoli over cooked rice.

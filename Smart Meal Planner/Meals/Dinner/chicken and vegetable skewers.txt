Ingredients:

2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
1 red bell pepper, cut into chunks
1 yellow bell pepper, cut into chunks
1 zucchini, sliced into thick rounds
1 red onion, cut into chunks
8-10 cherry tomatoes
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon paprika
Salt and pepper to taste
Wooden skewers, soaked in water for at least 30 minutes

Instructions:

In a bowl, combine the olive oil, minced garlic, dried oregano, dried basil, paprika, salt, and pepper. Mix well to create a marinade.

Add the chicken pieces to the marinade and toss until they are evenly coated. Let the chicken marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight in the refrigerator.

Preheat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat.

Thread the marinated chicken, bell peppers, zucchini, red onion, and cherry tomatoes onto the soaked wooden skewers, alternating the ingredients.

Brush the grill grates with oil to prevent sticking. Place the skewers on the preheated grill and cook for about 8-10 minutes, turning occasionally, or until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender.

Remove the skewers from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes.

Serve the chicken and vegetable skewers hot, and enjoy them as a main dish or with a side of rice or salad.

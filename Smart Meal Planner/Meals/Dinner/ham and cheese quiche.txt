Ingredients:

1 pre-made pie crust (9-inch)
1 cup cooked ham, diced
1 cup shredded cheese (such as cheddar, Swiss, or Gruyere)
4 large eggs
1 cup milk
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme (optional)
Pinch of nutmeg (optional)
Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

Instructions:

Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

Place the pre-made pie crust in a 9-inch pie dish. Press it firmly against the bottom and sides of the dish. Trim any excess crust hanging over the edges.

Sprinkle the diced ham evenly over the bottom of the pie crust. Then sprinkle the shredded cheese on top of the ham.

In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, heavy cream, salt, black pepper, dried thyme (if using), and nutmeg (if using).

Pour the egg mixture over the ham and cheese in the pie crust.

Carefully transfer the quiche to the preheated oven and bake for about 35-40 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the filling is set.

Remove the quiche from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. It will continue to set as it cools.

Garnish with chopped fresh parsley.

Slice and serve the ham and cheese quiche warm or at room temperature.

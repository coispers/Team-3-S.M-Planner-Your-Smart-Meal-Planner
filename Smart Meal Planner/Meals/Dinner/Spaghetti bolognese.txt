Ingredients:

8 ounces (225g) spaghetti
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 carrot, finely chopped
1 celery stalk, finely chopped
8 ounces (225g) ground beef
8 ounces (225g) ground pork
1 can (14 ounces/400g) crushed tomatoes
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
1/4 teaspoon black pepper (or to taste)
1/2 cup red wine (optional)
Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving
Fresh basil leaves, for garnish

Instructions:

Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.

In a large skillet or pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, carrot, and celery. Saut√© for about 5 minutes until the vegetables are softened.

Add the ground beef and ground pork to the skillet. Cook, breaking up the meat with a spoon, until browned and cooked through.

Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and black pepper. If using red wine, add it at this point. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let the sauce simmer for about 30 minutes to develop the flavors. If the sauce becomes too thick, you can add a little water or beef broth to thin it out.

Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning if needed.

Serve the spaghetti bolognese by placing a portion of cooked spaghetti on a plate or in a bowl. Top it with a generous ladle of the meat sauce.

Garnish with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh basil leaves.

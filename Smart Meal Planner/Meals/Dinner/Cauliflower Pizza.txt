Ingredients:

For the cauliflower crust:

1 medium head of cauliflower
2 eggs
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
Salt and pepper to taste

For the pizza toppings:

Tomato sauce or pizza sauce
Shredded mozzarella cheese
Your choice of toppings such as sliced bell peppers, mushrooms, onions, olives, or pepperoni

Instructions:

Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Cut the cauliflower into florets and pulse them in a food processor until they resemble rice-like grains.

Transfer the cauliflower rice to a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high for about 5-6 minutes until the cauliflower is tender. Let it cool for a few minutes.

Place the cooked cauliflower rice in a clean kitchen towel or cheesecloth and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. This step is important to achieve a crispy crust.

In a mixing bowl, combine the drained cauliflower rice, eggs, shredded mozzarella cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, dried oregano, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mix everything well to form a dough-like consistency.

Transfer the cauliflower dough to the prepared baking sheet. Press and shape it into a round or rectangular pizza crust, about 1/4-inch thick.

Bake the crust in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes or until it becomes golden and slightly crisp around the edges.

Remove the crust from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. At this point, you can choose to add your favorite pizza toppings.

Spread a layer of tomato sauce or pizza sauce over the crust, leaving a small border around the edges.

Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, and add your desired toppings such as sliced bell peppers, mushrooms, onions, olives, or pepperoni.

Return the topped pizza to the oven and bake for an additional 10-12 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.

Remove the cauliflower pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing.

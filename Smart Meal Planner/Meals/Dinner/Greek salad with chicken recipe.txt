Ingredients:

For the salad:

2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
Salt and pepper to taste
4 cups mixed salad greens
1 cucumber, sliced
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
1/2 cup Kalamata olives
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese

For the dressing:

3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried oregano
Salt and pepper to taste

Instructions:

Preheat the grill or stovetop grill pan over medium-high heat.

Rub the chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle with dried oregano, salt, and pepper.

Grill the chicken breasts for about 6-8 minutes per side, or until cooked through and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Remove from heat and let them rest for a few minutes. Slice the chicken into thin strips.

In a large bowl, combine the salad greens, cucumber slices, cherry tomatoes, red onion slices, Kalamata olives, and crumbled feta cheese.

In a separate small bowl, whisk together the extra virgin olive oil, red wine vinegar, minced garlic, dried oregano, salt, and pepper to make the dressing.

Pour the dressing over the salad ingredients and toss well to coat everything evenly.

Divide the salad among plates or bowls. Top each portion with the sliced grilled chicken.

Serve the Greek salad with chicken immediately and enjoy!

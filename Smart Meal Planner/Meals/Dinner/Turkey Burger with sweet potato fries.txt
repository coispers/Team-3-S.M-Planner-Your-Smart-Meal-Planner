Preheat your oven to 425째F (220째C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Shape the turkey mixture into burger patties, about 3/4-inch thick.

Place the turkey burgers on the prepared baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for about 18-20 minutes, or until cooked through and the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C).

Spread the sweet potato fries in a single layer on another baking sheet.

Bake the sweet potato fries in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, flipping them halfway through, until they are crispy and golden brown.

Once cooked, remove the turkey burgers and sweet potato fries from the oven.

Assemble your turkey burgers on burger buns, topping them with lettuce, tomato slices, and any other desired toppings.

Serve the turkey burgers with the crispy sweet potato fries on the side.

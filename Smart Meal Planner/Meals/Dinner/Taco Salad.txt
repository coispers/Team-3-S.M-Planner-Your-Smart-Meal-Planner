Ingredients:

For the salad:

1 pound ground beef or turkey
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 packet (about 2 tablespoons) taco seasoning
4 cups chopped lettuce (romaine or iceberg)
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
1 cup canned corn kernels, drained
1 cup canned black beans, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup diced red onion
1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1/4 cup sliced black olives
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro (optional)

For the dressing:

1/2 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 teaspoon taco seasoning

Optional toppings:

Crushed tortilla chips
Sliced avocado
Sliced jalapeños

Instructions:

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the ground beef or turkey and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned and cooked through.

Sprinkle the taco seasoning over the cooked meat and stir well to coat evenly. Remove from heat and set aside.

In a large salad bowl, layer the chopped lettuce, cherry tomatoes, corn kernels, black beans, diced red onion, shredded cheddar cheese, black olives, and chopped cilantro (if using).

In a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream, mayonnaise, lime juice, and taco seasoning to make the dressing.

Drizzle the dressing over the salad ingredients and toss well to combine.

Top the salad with the cooked ground beef or turkey.

If desired, add optional toppings such as crushed tortilla chips, sliced avocado, and sliced jalapeños.

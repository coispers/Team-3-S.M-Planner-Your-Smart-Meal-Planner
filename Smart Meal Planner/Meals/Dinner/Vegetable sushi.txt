Ingredients:

2 cups sushi rice
4 nori seaweed sheets
1 avocado, sliced
1 carrot, julienned
1 cucumber, julienned
1 red bell pepper, julienned
1/2 cup julienned or sliced radishes
Soy sauce, for serving
Wasabi and pickled ginger, for serving (optional)

Instructions:

Rinse the sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Cook the rice according to the package instructions. Once cooked, let it cool for a few minutes.

Lay a bamboo sushi mat on a clean surface. Place a sheet of nori on top of the mat.

Wet your hands with water to prevent sticking. Take about a handful of sushi rice and spread it evenly over the nori, leaving a small border at the top edge.

Place a few slices of avocado, carrot, cucumber, red bell pepper, and radishes horizontally across the center of the rice.

Using the sushi mat, start rolling the nori tightly away from you, tucking the vegetables inside. Apply gentle pressure to shape the roll.

Moisten the top border of the nori with a little water to seal the roll.

Repeat steps 2-6 to make additional rolls with the remaining ingredients.

Once all the rolls are made, use a sharp knife to slice each roll into bite-sized pieces. Dip the knife in water before each cut to prevent sticking.

Serve the vegetable sushi rolls with soy sauce for dipping. You can also serve them with wasabi and pickled ginger if desired.

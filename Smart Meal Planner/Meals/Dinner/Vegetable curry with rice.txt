Ingredients:

1 cup basmati rice
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon ginger, grated
1 teaspoon curry powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon turmeric
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)
1 can (14 ounces/400g) coconut milk
1 cup vegetable broth

1 medium zucchini, diced
1 cup cauliflower florets
1 cup green beans, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces

Instructions:

Cook the basmati rice according to the package instructions. Once cooked, fluff it with a fork and set it aside.

Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and saut√© for about 5 minutes until it becomes translucent.

Add the minced garlic and grated ginger to the skillet and cook for an additional minute until fragrant.

Stir in the curry powder, ground cumin, ground coriander, turmeric, and cayenne pepper (if using). Cook the spices for about 1 minute to release their flavors.

Pour in the coconut milk and vegetable broth. Stir well to combine the spices with the liquid.

Add the sliced carrot, diced bell pepper, diced zucchini, cauliflower florets, and green beans to the skillet. Stir everything together until the vegetables are coated with the sauce.

Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet, and let the curry simmer for about 15-20 minutes until the vegetables are tender. Stir occasionally.

Season the vegetable curry with salt and pepper to taste.

Serve the vegetable curry over a bed of cooked basmati rice. Garnish with fresh chopped cilantro.

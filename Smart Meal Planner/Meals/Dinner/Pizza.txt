Ingredients:

2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
2 ¼ teaspoons instant yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup warm water (around 110°F/43°C)
2 tablespoons olive oil
For the pizza sauce:

1 can (14 ounces) crushed tomatoes
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
Salt and pepper to taste
Toppings (feel free to customize):

Mozzarella cheese, shredded
Pepperoni slices
Sliced bell peppers
Sliced onions
Mushrooms, sliced
Fresh basil leaves (optional)

Instructions:

In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, instant yeast, sugar, and salt. Mix well.

Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the warm water and olive oil. Stir everything together until a dough forms.

Transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour; if it's too dry, add a little more water.

Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours until it doubles in size.

Meanwhile, prepare the pizza sauce by combining the crushed tomatoes, minced garlic, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Mix well and set aside.

Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C).

Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Transfer it to a floured surface and divide it into desired portions, depending on the size of the pizzas you want to make.

Roll out each portion of dough into a thin round or rectangular shape, about ¼-inch thick.

Place the rolled-out dough onto a baking sheet or pizza stone. Spread a layer of pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.

Add your desired toppings, such as shredded mozzarella cheese, pepperoni slices, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, and any other toppings you like.

Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for about 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese has melted and started to brown.

Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Optionally, garnish with fresh basil leaves before serving.

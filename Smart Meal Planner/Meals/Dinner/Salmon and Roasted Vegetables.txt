Ingredients:

2 salmon fillets
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried dill (or 1 tablespoon fresh dill, chopped)
Salt and pepper to taste
1 pound mixed vegetables (such as carrots, zucchini, bell peppers, and cherry tomatoes), cut into bite-sized pieces
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon honey
Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

Instructions:

Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, dried dill, salt, and pepper. Place the salmon fillets in a shallow dish or a resealable plastic bag and pour the marinade over them. Let them marinate for about 15-20 minutes.

While the salmon is marinating, prepare the vegetables. In a large bowl, toss the mixed vegetables with balsamic vinegar, honey, salt, and pepper until they are evenly coated.

Spread the vegetables in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Place the marinated salmon fillets on top of the vegetables.

Roast the salmon and vegetables in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork, and the vegetables are tender and slightly caramelized.

Once cooked, remove the baking sheet from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Sprinkle the roasted vegetables with fresh chopped parsley for garnish.

Serve the salmon and roasted vegetables hot. You can pair it with a side of rice, quinoa, or a fresh salad.

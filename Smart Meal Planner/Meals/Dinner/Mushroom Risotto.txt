Ingredients:

8 cups vegetable or chicken broth
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound mixed mushrooms (such as cremini, shiitake, or oyster), sliced
1 small onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups Arborio rice
1/2 cup dry white wine (optional)
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
Salt and pepper to taste
Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

Instructions:

In a large saucepan, bring the vegetable or chicken broth to a simmer. Keep it on low heat while you prepare the risotto.

In a separate large skillet or wide-bottomed pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the olive oil to prevent the butter from burning.

Add the sliced mushrooms to the skillet and sauté for about 5-6 minutes until they release their moisture and become golden brown. Remove half of the mushrooms from the skillet and set them aside for later.

In the same skillet, add the chopped onion and minced garlic. Sauté for about 3-4 minutes until the onion becomes translucent.

Add the Arborio rice to the skillet and stir it well to coat it with the butter and oil. Toast the rice for about 2 minutes, stirring constantly.

If using, pour the white wine into the skillet and stir until it is absorbed by the rice.

Begin adding the simmering broth to the skillet, one ladleful at a time. Stir the rice constantly and wait for each addition of broth to be absorbed before adding the next ladleful. Continue this process for about 20-25 minutes until the rice is creamy and al dente.

During the last few minutes of cooking, stir in the reserved sautéed mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Remove the skillet from heat and stir in the grated Parmesan cheese until it melts and blends into the risotto.

Let the risotto rest for a few minutes, covered, before serving. This allows it to thicken slightly.

Serve the mushroom risotto hot, garnished with fresh chopped parsley.

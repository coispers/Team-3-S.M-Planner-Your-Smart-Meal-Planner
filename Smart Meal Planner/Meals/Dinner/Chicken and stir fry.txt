Ingredients:

2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, sliced into thin strips
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons oyster sauce
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ginger, grated
1 onion, sliced
1 bell pepper, sliced
1 carrot, julienned
1 cup broccoli florets
Salt and pepper to taste
Optional toppings: sesame seeds, chopped green onions

Instructions:

In a bowl, combine the soy sauce, oyster sauce, and cornstarch. Add the chicken strips to the bowl and toss to coat them in the sauce mixture. Let it marinate for about 15-20 minutes.

Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger, and saut√© for about 1 minute until fragrant.

Add the marinated chicken to the skillet and stir-fry for 5-6 minutes until cooked through and browned. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside.

In the same skillet, add the sliced onion, bell pepper, carrot, and broccoli florets. Stir-fry for about 4-5 minutes until the vegetables are crisp-tender. Adjust the cooking time based on your preference for crunchiness.

Return the cooked chicken to the skillet with the vegetables. Stir everything together to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Continue to stir-fry for an additional 2-3 minutes until the flavors meld together and the vegetables are cooked to your liking.

Remove from heat and garnish with optional toppings such as sesame seeds and chopped green onions.

Serve the chicken and vegetable stir-fry over steamed rice or noodles, and enjoy!

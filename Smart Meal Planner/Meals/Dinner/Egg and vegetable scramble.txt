Ingredients:

4 large eggs
1/4 cup milk
Salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon butter or cooking oil
1/2 cup diced bell peppers (any color)
1/2 cup diced onions
1/2 cup diced tomatoes
1/2 cup chopped spinach or kale (optional)
1/4 cup shredded cheese (such as cheddar or mozzarella)

Instructions:

In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper until well combined. Set aside.

Heat the butter or cooking oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat.

Add the diced bell peppers and onions to the skillet and sauté for about 2-3 minutes until they start to soften.

Add the diced tomatoes and chopped spinach or kale (if using) to the skillet and continue to sauté for another 2 minutes until the vegetables are slightly cooked.

Pour the egg mixture into the skillet with the vegetables. Let it cook undisturbed for a minute or two until the edges start to set.

Using a spatula, gently scramble the eggs, stirring occasionally, until they are cooked to your desired doneness. This should take about 3-4 minutes.

Sprinkle the shredded cheese over the scrambled eggs and vegetables. Continue to cook for another minute or until the cheese melts.

Once the eggs are fully cooked and the cheese has melted, remove the skillet from heat.

Serve the egg and vegetable scramble hot, garnished with additional salt, pepper, or herbs if desired.
